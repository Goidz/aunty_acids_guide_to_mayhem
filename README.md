## Aunty Acid's guide to Mayhem

Aunty Acid's guide to Mayhem is a gig guide mainly focused at the underground music scene.
The idea is for it to be easy and quick for promoters to upload events and for the audience to search for events.
As an event attendee you are not required to sign up and can freely use the app as an event search tool.
As an event organizer you are required to create an account which then directly takes you to a form to fill out
with the most important event information. The user (event organiser) is also able to edit and delete their own event details.

I have unfortunately not been able to create a full readme file.
This will be completed in the future.
